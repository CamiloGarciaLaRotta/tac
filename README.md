## How to setup the project
Please check our [contributors guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why use the Tack Extension
The Chrome extension is meant to be an ad-hoc way to track any type of application you want to or have already applied. When the users are on a websitew with a posting, they don't need to stop browsing in order to open a tracker service on a separate tab. Instead, they can start tracking the given application via the popup form directly on the posting website.

This Chrome Extension is the fork of a school project regarding a broader service to track applications.
The fork intends to remove dependencies on external web APIs, simplyfying the use cases and making the extension self contained.

You can find more information on the use cases this fork attempts to address, as well as insights into the design process in the [Design Thinking Gist](https://gist.github.com/CamiloGarciaLaRotta/d1e1a6d64e413e931233f8accf72057b)

## Architecture
```bash
           popup.html
               |
             App.re
               |
            JobApp.re
               |
        ScrapingInputs.re
```

The system leverages the following modules
- `ScrapingFunctions.re`: functions related to extracting/processing HTML elements
- `Services.re`: functions related to asynchronous actions
- `SyncStorage.re`: functions related to the Chrome storage management
- `Uilities.re`: general purpose helper functions

## Limitations
* Currently, the only supported `posted date` scraper pattern is `"<num> days ago"`
* Currently, the extension does not have a `deadline date` scraper
* Because of the [bucklescript-chrome](https://github.com/jchavarri/bucklescript-chrome.git#start-extensions) bindings used to build the extension,  
we are locked with outdated versions of core libraries such as `React` and `Bucklescript`
* For the same reason as above, we can't use Chrome's [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts).  
    Instead we inject a script into the active website to extract DOM information.
